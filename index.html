        <div class="overlay">
            <p class="text-center text-white s-text m-text">My names are Maranatha Uwase MOZA MWENGE i am a
                congolaise who lives in Kigali city for seven
                years.
                I did Electronics and telecommunication in high school and finished in 2016.
                but after ending the high school studies i joined Centre de Recherches Agro-Alimentaire(CRAA) which
                is
                situated in Lubumbashi
                Province du Katanga, in DRC where i was working as an Assistant maintenance Technician for one year
                , but then i came back and started to work in PHOENIX METAL which is currently Luna Smelter it was a
                little bit complicated because
                the majority of workers were men. there were men evrywhere, women are like 1/5 of all the employees.
                so
                i had to
                go through it. we never live as we wish in life. but finally i came to be familial with them... ad
                continued life normally.
                by then i started the university and i was doing BIT (Business information Technolgy) but i had to
                stop
                working because iwas unable to combine the two
                of them.</p><br>

            <p>What i can say about my hobbies: <br>
                i like and adore singing, and i practice it every single day, <br>
                I like staying home discovering some new cooking tips some new recipes and natural hair tutorials<br />
                in few words i adore being a house girl.<br>
                I like joking. because it helps so much.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-center text-white s-text m-text"><b>So the reason why i joined programming lessons is because
                    even if i was doing BIT there is not much
                    IT
                    which someone can practice in the daily life.
                    it's only Business. so i wanted to learn more and at least becoming a developper. and finding a
                    better
                    job or creating one myself.</b>
